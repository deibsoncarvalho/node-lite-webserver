# Small static web server for testing web pages.

written in Node, the script only provides files in html, js, css and simple images.

I repeat, it is very simple, it does not provide the necessary structure for an automated test, staging or production web server. 

**Nowhere use this script in production! There are no security, stability or performance policies for a real server.**

## Install

Download the zipped folder, extract and at the root, run the command:

~~~
npm install
~~~

## Use

To use the server, after installation, run the command:

~~~
npm start
~~~
